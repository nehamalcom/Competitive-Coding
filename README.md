## Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets
Given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k. We need to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden. The garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] and then can be used in exactly one bouquet. Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden.

# Decode string
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer. You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

# Single Row Keyboard
There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row. Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25). Initially, your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|. You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

# Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

# Maximum Distance to Person
You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed). There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting. Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
